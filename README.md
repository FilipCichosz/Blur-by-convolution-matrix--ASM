# BlurASM

Written in C#, C++, and MASM64. Program applies a box blur to an image using matrix convolution.

## Algorithm Explanation

The algorithm uses the box blur technique, which involves convolving the image with a matrix. Each pixel in the image is replaced by the average of its neighboring pixels within a defined kernel size. The code reads the image, applies the convolution matrix to blur the image, and writes the resulting image to a new file.

## Installation

1. Download the project.
2. Install necessary dependencies using the Package Manager.
3. Build the application.
